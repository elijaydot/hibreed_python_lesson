git remote add origin https://github.com/superdalton/hibreed_python_lesson.git 
NB: origin can be anything, it is just an alias

git branch -M main 
NB: Git has branches, and can be created. Main was previously called Master, but not anymore. 
your local repository will contain main branch

git push origin main

git remote add origin https://github.com/superdalton/hibreed_python_lesson.git

git push -u origin main


git

Open terminal to the path of the project
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "My hibreed python lessons"
git branch -M main
git push origin main


git pull origin main

git clone https://github.com/superdalton/hibreed_python_lesson.git


creating branches in git (use the -b flag when creating a new branch)
git checkout -b chat

NB: say we agreed that only finished work go to main branch, hence, we can create several branches for several aspect of the proced
git push origin chat

to go back to main branch 
git checkout main


Step 1: Clone the repository or update your local repository with the latest changes.

git pull origin main
Step 2: Switch to the base branch of the pull request.

git checkout main
Step 3: Merge the head branch into the base branch.

git merge tests
Step 4: Push the changes.

git push -u origin main
